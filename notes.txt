Objective:

1) check for a file next to glyphs source, or in application preferences, mapping colours to labels

2) parse information into a dictionary, and preserve the order (allowing the display of fewer than all labels, and custom colour order)

3) draw the colour swatches in order (CanvasView), and create the text labels (vanilla TextBox[es] - current implementation seems very messy)

4) update dependent on active window.

It currently (kind-of) works. If i have sourceA with a labelkey.txt file next to the glyphs source and sourceB iwthout and using the one in Glyphs/Info, the following reproduces:

open sourceA: blank labels
click on sourceA window: labels update
open sourceB: swatches are drawn correctly, labels remain the same
click on sourceA window: everything drawn as desired.
click on sourceB window: everything drawn as desired.
However: theswatched always reflect the active window, even tough the labels may not.

Primary issues (aside from and likely related to it not working as intended):

1) duplicate code - I need to get the data from the txt file for draw(), but can't get the labels to update if i reuse them with self.order and self.colourLabels . Colour swatch do update however.

2) there must be a better way to 'write' the labels without delattr. I think i'm putting things in the wrong place.

3) do I need start() and a callback at all?
